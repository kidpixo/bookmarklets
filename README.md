# Bookmarklets


This is a collection of javascript fragments I wrote. There are some instructions on my [blog (it is in Italian)](http://kidpix.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/come-ti-scrivo-un-bookmarlet-per-tntvillage/) on how to use it in Chrome as shortcuts exploting the embedded Search Engines.

You can use them just saving as bookmark in your browser and then pressing on it when you are on the page you want to work on.

There is a simple html page you can try:

- load the [test_page.html](https://rawgithub.com/kidpixo/bookmarklets/master/test_page.html)**
- use the bookmarlet

The new version of the bookmarklet works without PopUp window, it refreshes the actual page and leaves only the ed2k links as text one per line. You can copy it and feed it e/amule directly.

The PoPUp bookmarlet gives you ad result a new window listing all the ed2k links. 

The `test_page.html` contains actually some `ed2k` links for testing.
