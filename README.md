# Bookmarklets


This is a collection of javascript fragments I wrote. There are some instructions on my [blog (it is in Italian)](http://kidpix.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/come-ti-scrivo-un-bookmarlet-per-tntvillage/) on how to use it in Chrome as shortcuts exploting the embedded Search Engines.

You can use them just saving as bookmark in your browser and then pressing on it when you are on the page you want to work on.

There is a simple html page you can try:

- load the [test_page.html](https://rawgithub.com/kidpixo/bookmarklets/master/test_page.html)**
- use the bookmarlet

You have 3 version to date (in order of freshness)  :

#### The Prompt version 
It popups a prompt window with the links already selected. Just copy with your shortcuts (Command-C for mac , Ctrl-C for Win/Linux/Unix) and press Enter to close.

#### The No-PopUP version 

It works without PopUp window, it refreshes the actual page and leaves only the ed2k links as text one per line. You can copy it and feed it e/amule directly.

#### The PoPUp version

This bookmarlet gives you ad result a new window listing all the ed2k links. 

The `test_page.html` contains actually some `ed2k` links for testing.
