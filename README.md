# Bookmarklets


This is a collection of javascript fragments I wrote. There are some instructions on my [blog (it is in Italian)](http://kidpix.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/come-ti-scrivo-un-bookmarlet-per-tntvillage/) on how to use it in Chrome as shortcuts exploting the embedded Search Engines.

You can use them just saving as bookmark in your browser and then pressing on it when you are on the page you want to work on.

There is a simple html page you can try:

- load the `test_page.html`
- use the bookmarlet

As result you will get a new window listing all the useful links, the `test_page.html` contains actually some `ed2k` links for testing.
